        You probably don't want to use the #{storage.class} storage whilst
        using boom in remote mode. Your config looks akin to:

        #{red File.read Boom.config.file}

        but things might be better with something a little more like:

        #{cyan Boom::Storage::Redis.sample_config}

        or

        #{cyan Boom::Storage::Mongodb.sample_config}

        Now head yourself on over to #{yellow Boom.config.file}
        and edit some goodness into it

        Meanwhile, please enjoy your ordinary boom service:
